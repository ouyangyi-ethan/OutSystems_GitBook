### **Video1 \(Bootstrapping your application from a UI template\)**

1. Each application is made up of Modules.

2. Whenever you create a new Module, you can select a predefined responsive theme. In this video, the presenter chose the **London Responsive Theme**

3. An application can have Entities - which are nothing but the Data-Types used in your application. These are similar to the CDTs in Appian. Entities are under the "Data" tab.

4. You can **Bootstrap an Entity** - meaning you can quickly pull some data - from an Excel file.
