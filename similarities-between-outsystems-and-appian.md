## **Similarities Between OutSystems and Appian from a Developer Perspective**

1. Both provide an **Expression Editor**.

2. The TableRecords widget has properties that you can set that are similar to the properties that we need to specify for a `gridField` or a `a!dataSubset` in Appian. Both have `startIndex`, `batchSize`, a configurable message when there are no records etc.

3. Both provide a visual way to create Database entities.

4. Both have the concept of **Roles**. We have Anonymous Role, Registered Role, and a role per Application in OutSystems. This is like Groups in Appian.
