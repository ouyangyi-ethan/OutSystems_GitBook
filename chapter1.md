# About OutSystems

OutSystems is a low code platform for developing applications - which can be mobile enabled, and also be deployed in the Cloud.

Development can be done in the **Service Studio IDE** which is available for Windows OS.

The local changes are pushed to the cloud environment provided by **1-click** deployment. The platform generates all the required SQL scripts and the C\#\/.NET code \(if you are using the C\# stack as the backend\). Java\/J2EE stack is also supported. On mobile, the applications generated are a mix of native and hybrid capabilities. As mentioned in the demo, the platform actually uses Apache Cordova libraries for generating mobile apps. The HTML\/JS generated is actually generated using ReactJS behind the scenes \(the presenter attributed it to faster UI performance in the latest version of the platform\). It is also possible to develop directly in the Cloud environment.

Currently going through the **Phone-Book** application given in the free video tutorials. Below are my notes\/summaries per video \(in the same order\)

Every application has objects which can be categorized into - **Process**, **Interface**, **Logic** and **Data**.
