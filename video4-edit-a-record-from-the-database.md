### **Video4 \(Edit a Record from the Database\)**

1. You can have Buttons - Save and Cancel on the `ContactDetail` screen.

2. A Button can have an associated **Screen Action** which encapsulates the logic to execute when that Button is clicked. For eg: You may have a Screen Action to save the data to a database. The logic is executed at the Server side.

3. A Button can also have a Destination Web Screen instead of a Screen Action. For eg: you can redirect the user back to the `Contacts` screen after he clicks on the `Cancel` button.

4. Inside a Screen Action, you can call other Actions - like `UpdateContact` action which updates a record in the database.
