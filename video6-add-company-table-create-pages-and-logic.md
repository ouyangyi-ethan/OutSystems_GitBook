### **Video6 \(Add Company Table, create pages and logic\)**

1. In this video, we created a new Entity - Company. We also added the pages for Companies and Company Detail. We created a preparation and Save actions for them.

2. We also added them to the main workflow.

3. Now, you can add a link in the common menu bar. We added a link in the Contacts page to the Companies page.

4. To quickly setup a link from the Contacts page to the Companies page, you just have to drop the Web Screen for the Companies in the Menu bar of the Contacts page. Caveat: The common menu bar does not appear until you preview your page in the desktop\/tablet mode. You can add the menu and then turn off the preview.
